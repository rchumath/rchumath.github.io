## Biography

I am an NSF RTG Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am being mentored by [Professor Mykhaylo Shkolnikov](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~mshkolni/) and [Professor Sergey Nadtochiy](https://sites.google.com/view/sergey-nadtochiy).

I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2025, where I was advised by [Professor Inwon Kim](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~ikim/).

## Research Interests

My research explores the interface between probability theory, partial differential equations (PDEs), optimal transport, and machine learning with interests including:

- Free boundary problems and phase transition models  
- Development and analysis of numerical schemes for nonlinear PDEs and optimal transport
- Machine Learning and Generative Modeling

## Selected Honors and Awards

- *Pacific Journal of Mathematics Dissertation Award*, Pacific Journal of Mathematics (2025)  
- *Dissertation Year Fellowship*, UCLA (2024)  
- *Liggett Teaching Fellow*, UCLA (2023)  
- *Horn-Moez Prize for Excellence in First-Year Ph.D. Studies*, UCLA (2021)
