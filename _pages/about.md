## Biography

I am an NSF RTG Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am mentored by [Professor Mykhaylo Shkolnikov](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~mshkolni/), [Professor Sergey Nadtochiy](https://sites.google.com/view/sergey-nadtochiy), and [Professor Dejan Slepƒçev](https://www.cmu.edu/math/people/faculty/slepcev.html)

I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2025, where I was advised by [Professor Inwon Kim](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~ikim/).

## Research Interests

My research explores the interface between probability theory, partial differential equations (PDEs), and optimal transport, with interests including:

- Free boundary problems and phase transition models  
- Probabilistic representations of nonlinear PDEs  
- Development and analysis of numerical schemes for nonlinear PDEs and optimal transport
- Diffusion models and their mathematical foundations
