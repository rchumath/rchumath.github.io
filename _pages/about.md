## Biography

I am an NSF RTG Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University, starting in August 2025. My research focuses on analytical, variational, and stochastic approaches to the analyze and develop numerical schemes of physical models.

I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2025, where I was advised by [Professor Inwon Kim](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~ikim/). I also completed my undergraduate studies in Applied Mathematics at UCLA, where I conducted undergraduate research under the mentorship of [Professor Marcus Roper](https://www.marcusroper.org).
