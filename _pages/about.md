## Biography

I am an NSF RTG Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University, starting in August 2025. 

I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2025, where I was advised by [Professor Inwon Kim](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~ikim/).

## Research Interests

My research explores the interface between partial differential equations (PDEs), stochastic analysis, and optimal transport, with interests including:

- Free boundary problems and phase transition models  
- Probabilistic representations of nonlinear PDEs  
- Development and analysis of numerical schemes for nonlinear PDEs and optimal transport
- Diffusion models and their mathematical foundations

## Selected Honors and Awards

- *Pacific Journal of Mathematics Dissertation Award*, Pacific Journal of Mathematics (2025)  
- *Dissertation Year Fellowship*, UCLA (2024)  
- *Liggett Teaching Fellow*, UCLA (2023)  
- *Horn-Moez Prize for Excellence in First-Year Ph.D. Studies*, UCLA (2021)
